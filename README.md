### Overview of the analysis: 

##### Last summer when visiting Hawaii I discovered a new passion for surfing. While on vacationn I have come up with a plan in investing on surf shop and reached out to an invester who have the same passion as mine. W. Avy.


##### W. Avy likes my business plan and analysis, but he wants more information about temperature trends before opening the surf shop. Specifically, he wants temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu, in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round. The investor's main concern is the precipitation forcing the shop to close too frequently. To analyze Hawaii's weather data, SQLAlchemy was used to query the SQLite database.


### Results: Provide a bulleted list with three major points from the two analysis deliverables. Use images as support where needed.

##### - The average temperature in June and December is approximately 75 and 71 degree fahrenheit respectively. 
##### - The standard deviation lays just below 4 degrees, and  
##### - The minimum temperature in June and December is 64 and 56 degree fahrenheit respectively.

### June Statistics for the Temperature

### Summary:  

##### Comparing the June and December weather patterns, the temperatures averages are reasonably close and the minimims are not that low. Hence, the data supports opening a Surf and Ice Cream shop year-round. I would also perform a queries to get the precipitation analysis for June and December, and another quesry to calculate the daily temperatures with statistical summary for randomly selected days in the months of June and December.
